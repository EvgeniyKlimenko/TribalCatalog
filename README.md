# TribalCatalog
A pet application aimed to combine graphic and video data concerning tribal fusion dance movements.
Written in C# and aimed for investigating .NET API, WinForms controls, classes, tools and best practices.
It doesn't produce setup distributive, it can be just compiled and run from the Visual Studio IDE.

Honestly saying, nobody beside me needs such an app, even my wife have been dancing tribal fusion for a long time.
First and foremost I am the main beneficiary of this app allowing me to be a proving ground for .NET controls and concepts.
